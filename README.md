# The Bento Working Group is Now Deprecated
As of November 3rd, 2021 the **Bento** Working Group is deprecated, and has been merged back into the **Component** [Working Group](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#working-groups). Previously it was responsible for evaluating, designing, and implementing the architecture in which AMP elements can be used without AMP Runtime, and/or within popular Web frameworks.

`@ampproject/wg-bento` can be used to mention the Bento Working Group in issues and PRs.

# Code of Conduct
This working group follows the [AMP open source project code of conduct](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
